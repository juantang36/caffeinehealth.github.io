# Motivation
Coffee is one of the most widely consumed beverages in the world, but existing research offers mixed evidence. Some studies suggest benefits like lower diabetes or cardiovascular risk, while others point to possible harms, like elevated blood pressure or disrupted sleep. Because almost everyone drinks coffee, we wanted to take a closer look using objective, nationally representative measurements from NHANES.
