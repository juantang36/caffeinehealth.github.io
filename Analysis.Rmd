## Overview of analytic strategy
In this analysis, we first compared individuals (age range: 20-70) with and without coffee intake habits based on the results of two 24-hour dietary recall surveys and experimental biomarker data. Subsequently, we employed regression models to investigate the dose-response relationship between caffeine intake and selected biomarkers.

We organized the analysis in two steps: 

- Comparison between groups of individuals with and without coffee-intake habits.
- Regression analyses with continuous caffeine intake as the exposure.


## Group Comparisons: Coffee Intake vs No Coffe Intake


### Coffee Intake and Blood Pressure & Pulse
To assess whether habitual coffee consumption is related to blood pressure and pulse, we compared systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and resting pulse between adults with and without coffee-drinking habits. The violin plots with embedded boxplots display the distributions of SBP and DBP by coffee habit, and a line plot shows group means with 95% confidence intervals. Pulse-rate distributions were visualized using ridgeline density plots.

The violin plots indicate that SBP and DBP distributions are very similar between coffee drinkers and non-drinkers. There is a slight upward shift in the coffee-habit group for SBP, reflected in the mean plot as a small increase of only a few mmHg, whereas DBP means are nearly identical in the two groups. In both cases, the 95% confidence intervals overlap substantially, suggesting that any differences in average blood pressure associated with habitual coffee intake are modest and may not be statistically or clinically important.

For pulse rate, the ridgeline densities show broadly overlapping distributions, with the coffee-habit group trending slightly higher in pulse but again with only minor separation between curves. This pattern suggests that regular coffee drinkers may have a somewhat higher resting heart rate, but the magnitude of the difference appears small at the population level.

From a cardiovascular-risk perspective, mean SBP and DBP in both groups fall within the normotensive to mildly elevated range, and the between-group differences are much smaller than thresholds used to define hypertension (e.g., SBP ≥ 130 mmHg). Overall, our unadjusted comparisons do not provide strong evidence that habitual coffee consumption is associated with substantial chronic elevations in blood pressure or resting pulse. As with the diabetes biomarkers, these results are cross-sectional and may be confounded by age, BMI, smoking, medication use, physical activity, and other lifestyle factors. Therefore, they should be interpreted as descriptive and hypothesis-generating. In subsequent regression analyses, we will examine dose–response relationships between caffeine intake and blood pressure and pulse while adjusting for key confounders.


### Coffee Intake and Sleep Status
To explore whether habitual coffee consumption is related to sleep, we compared self-reported sleep duration between adults with and without coffee-intake habits. Average nightly sleep time was summarized using violin plots with embedded boxplots, and a paired line plot was used to display within-person differences between weekday and weekend sleep by coffee habit.

The violin plots show that the overall distributions of average sleep duration are very similar in coffee drinkers and non-drinkers. Both groups cluster around roughly 7–8 hours of sleep per night, with a comparable spread and long tails toward shorter and longer sleep. The coffee-habit group appears to sleep slightly fewer hours on average, but the central ranges of the two distributions overlap extensively, suggesting that any difference in mean sleep time between coffee drinkers and non-drinkers is relatively small.

The paired weekday–weekend plot highlights within-person patterns. In coffee intake groups, individuals tend to sleep more on weekends than on weekdays, consistent with “catch-up” sleep. The black summary lines indicate that the magnitude of the weekday–weekend increase is nearly the same for coffee drinkers and non-drinkers, implying that habitual coffee use does not materially alter the typical pattern of shorter weekday sleep and longer weekend sleep.

Taken together, these descriptive results do not suggest that regular coffee consumption is associated with large reductions in average sleep duration or with a different pattern of weekday versus weekend sleep in this NHANES adult sample. If anything, coffee drinkers may sleep marginally less on average, but the between-group differences are modest relative to the wide variability in sleep across individuals. As with other outcomes, these cross-sectional comparisons rely on self-reported sleep and are unadjusted for potential confounders (e.g., work schedules, shift work, stress, mental health), and thus should be interpreted cautiously as descriptive rather than causal.


### Coffee Intake and Diabetes Risk
Among participants with complete diabetes biomarker data (N = 2439), we compared fasting glucose, glycohemoglobin (HbA1c), and fasting insulin between adults with and without coffee intake habit. The bar plot shows mean biomarker levels with 95% confidence intervals by coffee habit, and the table summarizes group means, mean differences, confidence intervals, and p-values.

Across the three biomarkers, fasting glucose and HbA1c were very similar in coffee drinkers and non-drinkers, whereas fasting insulin remained substantially lower among coffee drinkers. The mean fasting glucose levels were 108.89 mg/dL in the no-coffee group and 109.48 mg/dL in the coffee group, with a mean difference of 0.58 mg/dL (95% CI: –2.93, 4.10; p = 0.745). Mean HbA1c levels were 5.71% and 5.76%, respectively, with a difference of 0.04 percentage points (95% CI: –0.06, 0.15; p = 0.427). For both markers, confidence intervals include zero and p-values are large, indicating no statistically significant difference in average glycemic control between the two groups. In contrast, fasting insulin averaged 17.35 μU/mL in non-drinkers and 12.12 μU/mL in coffee drinkers, with a mean difference of –5.23 μU/mL (95% CI: –7.89, –2.56; p ≈ 1.3×10⁻⁴), reflecting a statistically and clinically meaningful decrease in fasting insulin among those with a coffee habit.

From a diabetes-risk perspective, these findings suggest that habitual coffee intake is not associated with worse glycemic control as measured by fasting glucose and HbA1c in this adult NHANES sample. At the same time, lower fasting insulin at similar glucose and HbA1c levels may be consistent with differences in insulin sensitivity or insulin secretion—for example, better insulin sensitivity (requiring less insulin to maintain comparable glucose levels) or reduced β-cell secretory capacity. With cross-sectional data and only three biomarkers, we cannot distinguish between these mechanisms, and the implications for long-term diabetes risk remain uncertain.

Moreover, these comparisons are unadjusted and may be strongly influenced by confounding. Coffee drinkers in NHANES are likely to differ from non-drinkers in age, BMI, smoking, overall diet, physical activity, and socioeconomic factors, all of which affect glycemic control and diabetes risk. Therefore, the current results should not be interpreted as strong causal evidence that coffee itself increases or decreases diabetes risk. Instead, they highlight distinct diabetes biomarker profiles—particularly lower fasting insulin—among coffee-habit groups and motivate the next step of our analysis: regression models and examine dose–response relationships between caffeine intake and diabetes-related outcomes.


### Coffee Intake and Cardiovascular Disease Risk
To evaluate whether habitual coffee consumption is associated with cardiovascular risk profiles, we compared three lipid biomarkers: high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LD), and total cholesterol, between adults with and without coffee intake habit. The violin plot with embedded boxplot display the distributions of each biomarker by coffee habit, and a summary table reports group means, mean differences, 95% confidence intervals, and p-values from two-sample t-tests.

Coffee drinkers had higher average levels of all three lipid markers, although the strength of evidence varied by biomarker.

- HDL (“good” cholesterol): Mean HDL was 53.45 mg/dL in non-drinkers and 56.32 mg/dL in coffee drinkers, with a mean difference of 2.87 mg/dL (95% CI: 1.39, 4.35; p ≈ 0.00015). This indicates a statistically significant and modestly higher HDL-C level among coffee drinkers.

- LDL: Mean LDL-C was 112.17 mg/dL in the No coffee group and 115.52 mg/dL in the Coffee habit group, for a difference of 3.36 mg/dL (95% CI: –0.22, 6.94; p ≈ 0.066). The confidence interval includes zero and the p-value is slightly above 0.05, suggesting only weak evidence for higher LDL-C in coffee drinkers.

- Total cholesterol: Mean total cholesterol was 187.33 mg/dL among non-drinkers and 193.80 mg/dL among coffee drinkers, with a mean difference of 6.47 mg/dL (95% CI: 2.28, 10.65; p ≈ 0.0025), indicating a statistically significant but modest increase in total cholesterol associated with coffee habit.

From a CVD-risk perspective, this pattern is somewhat mixed but not clearly adverse. The higher HDL among coffee drinkers is generally considered protective, as higher HDL is associated with lower cardiovascular risk. At the same time, coffee drinkers also show slightly higher total cholesterol and possibly higher LDL-C, though the LDL difference is small and only borderline significant. The absolute differences in LDL-C and total cholesterol (≈3–6 mg/dL) are relatively modest compared with clinical thresholds used to define dyslipidemia, so their practical impact on risk is likely limited in isolation.

As with other outcomes in this study, these comparisons are cross-sectional and unadjusted. Coffee drinkers may differ from non-drinkers in diet, BMI, smoking, alcohol use, physical activity, and use of lipid-lowering medications, all of which strongly influence lipid levels. Consequently, the observed associations should not be interpreted as causal effects of coffee itself on CVD risk. Rather, they highlight that adults with a coffee habit in NHANES tend to have a lipid profile characterized by higher HDL and slightly higher total cholesterol, a combination whose net impact on cardiovascular risk is uncertain and warrants further evaluation in adjusted regression models and longitudinal studies.

## Regression Analysis
### Associations Between Caffeine Intake and Diabetes Biomarkers
We examined dose–response relationships between caffeine intake and diabetes-related biomarkers using simple linear regression models with daily caffeine intake (mg) as a continuous exposure and HbA1c, fasting insulin, or fasting glucose as outcomes. Fitted regression lines were overlaid on scatterplots to aid interpretation.

Although none of the regression coefficients reached conventional statistical significance, the direction and pattern of the estimates are broadly consistent with a potential influence of caffeine on glucose metabolism, especially for insulin. For HbA1c, the estimated slope for caffeine was slightly negative (–0.000138 percentage points per 1 mg; p = 0.51), corresponding to an approximately 0.014 percentage-point decrease in HbA1c per 100 mg of caffeine, albeit with wide confidence intervals. Fasting glucose showed a similarly small negative slope (–0.0039 mg/dL per 1 mg; p = 0.54).

The most notable pattern was observed for fasting insulin, where higher caffeine intake was associated with lower insulin levels (–0.0037 μU/mL per 1 mg; p = 0.15), or roughly 0.37 μU/mL lower insulin per 100 mg of caffeine. In the scatterplot, individuals with very high fasting insulin concentrations are concentrated among those with little or no caffeine intake, whereas participants with higher caffeine intake tend to have relatively low insulin levels. This visual pattern, together with the negative regression slope, is compatible with the hypothesis that habitual caffeine consumption may be linked to lower insulin requirements at a given level of glycemia, i.e., potentially better insulin sensitivity.

However, these apparent trends are modest in magnitude and imprecisely estimated, as reflected in the wide confidence intervals and very low R² values. Caffeine intake explains only a tiny fraction of the between-person variation in HbA1c, glucose, or insulin, and the cross-sectional, unadjusted nature of these models means that residual confounding by age, adiposity, diet quality, physical activity, medication use, and underlying disease is likely. Thus, while our regression analyses do not demonstrate a strong or definitive dose–response relationship, they do suggest that higher caffeine intake is not associated with worse glycemic control and may be associated with slightly lower fasting insulin, in line with the group comparisons between coffee drinkers and non-drinkers. These findings are best viewed as hypothesis-generating and motivate more detailed, adjusted modeling of insulin resistance and diabetes outcomes in future work.


### Associations Between Caffeine Intake and CVD Biomarkers
We also investigated whether higher caffeine intake is related to cardiovascular risk profiles by fitting linear regression models with daily caffeine intake (mg) as a continuous exposure and total cholesterol, HDL, or LDL as outcomes. For each biomarker, we fit a separate model and visualized the fitted regression line with a 95% confidence band overlaid on scatterplots of caffeine intake versus lipid level.

Overall, caffeine intake showed only weak and imprecise linear associations with lipid biomarkers, but the directions of the estimated slopes are broadly consistent with the group comparisons between coffee drinkers and non-drinkers. For total cholesterol, the estimated slope was +0.0052 mg/dL per 1 mg of caffeine (SE 0.0083; p = 0.53), corresponding to an increase of about +0.52 mg/dL per 100 mg of caffeine. For LDL, the slope was +0.0081 mg/dL per 1 mg (SE 0.0072; p = 0.26), or roughly +0.81 mg/dL per 100 mg of caffeine. In contrast, HDL showed a small negative slope of –0.0020 mg/dL per 1 mg (SE 0.0029; p = 0.50), equivalent to about –0.20 mg/dL per 100 mg of caffeine. In all three models, R² values were essentially zero, indicating that caffeine intake explains almost none of the substantial between-person variability in lipid levels.

The scatterplots support these numerical findings: most observations cluster at low-to-moderate caffeine intakes with a wide spread in lipid levels, and the fitted regression lines are nearly flat with wide confidence bands. Nonetheless, the slightly positive slopes for total cholesterol and LDL and the slightly negative slope for HDL are directionally compatible with the cross-sectional comparisons, where habitual coffee drinkers tended to have somewhat higher total cholesterol and LDL alongside higher HDL. Taken together, these patterns suggest that, if caffeine intake does influence lipid levels, the effect is likely small and complex, and easily overshadowed by other determinants such as diet quality, adiposity, smoking, alcohol use, medication, and genetic factors.

Because these models are cross-sectional, unadjusted, and have very low explanatory power, they should not be interpreted as evidence that increasing caffeine intake meaningfully worsens or improves cardiovascular risk. Rather, the regression results indicate that within the observed range of everyday caffeine consumption, any dose–response relationship with lipid biomarkers is subtle at best, and they primarily serve to complement our group comparisons and to generate hypotheses for more detailed, adjusted analyses in future work.
