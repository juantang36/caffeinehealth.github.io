## Overview of analytic strategy
In this analysis, we first compared individuals (age range: 20-70) with and without coffee intake habits based on the results of two 24-hour dietary recall surveys and experimental biomarker data. Subsequently, we employed regression models to investigate the dose-response relationship between caffeine intake and selected biomarkers.

We organized the analysis in two steps: 

- Comparison between groups of individuals with and without coffee-intake habits.
- Regression analyses with continuous caffeine intake as the exposure.


## Group Comparisons: Coffee Intake vs No Coffe Intake

### Coffee Intake and Blood Pressure & Pulse
To assess whether habitual coffee consumption is related to blood pressure and pulse, we compared systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and resting pulse between adults with and without coffee-drinking habits. The violin plots with embedded boxplots display the distributions of SBP and DBP by coffee habit, and a line plot shows group means with 95% confidence intervals. Pulse-rate distributions were visualized using ridgeline density plots.

The violin plots indicate that SBP and DBP distributions are very similar between coffee drinkers and non-drinkers. There is a slight upward shift in the coffee-habit group for SBP, reflected in the mean plot as a small increase of only a few mmHg, whereas DBP means are nearly identical in the two groups. In both cases, the 95% confidence intervals overlap substantially, suggesting that any differences in average blood pressure associated with habitual coffee intake are modest and may not be statistically or clinically important.

For pulse rate, the ridgeline densities show broadly overlapping distributions, with the coffee-habit group trending slightly higher in pulse but again with only minor separation between curves. This pattern suggests that regular coffee drinkers may have a somewhat higher resting heart rate, but the magnitude of the difference appears small at the population level.

From a cardiovascular-risk perspective, mean SBP and DBP in both groups fall within the normotensive to mildly elevated range, and the between-group differences are much smaller than thresholds used to define hypertension (e.g., SBP ≥ 130 mmHg). Overall, our unadjusted comparisons do not provide strong evidence that habitual coffee consumption is associated with substantial chronic elevations in blood pressure or resting pulse. As with the diabetes biomarkers, these results are cross-sectional and may be confounded by age, BMI, smoking, medication use, physical activity, and other lifestyle factors. Therefore, they should be interpreted as descriptive and hypothesis-generating. In subsequent regression analyses, we will examine dose–response relationships between caffeine intake and blood pressure and pulse while adjusting for key confounders.


### Coffee Intake and Sleep Status
To explore whether habitual coffee consumption is related to sleep, we compared self-reported sleep duration between adults with and without coffee-intake habits. Average nightly sleep time was summarized using violin plots with embedded boxplots, and a paired line plot was used to display within-person differences between weekday and weekend sleep by coffee habit.

The violin plots show that the overall distributions of average sleep duration are very similar in coffee drinkers and non-drinkers. Both groups cluster around roughly 7–8 hours of sleep per night, with a comparable spread and long tails toward shorter and longer sleep. The coffee-habit group appears to sleep slightly fewer hours on average, but the central ranges of the two distributions overlap extensively, suggesting that any difference in mean sleep time between coffee drinkers and non-drinkers is relatively small.

The paired weekday–weekend plot highlights within-person patterns. In coffee intake groups, individuals tend to sleep more on weekends than on weekdays, consistent with “catch-up” sleep. The black summary lines indicate that the magnitude of the weekday–weekend increase is nearly the same for coffee drinkers and non-drinkers, implying that habitual coffee use does not materially alter the typical pattern of shorter weekday sleep and longer weekend sleep.

Taken together, these descriptive results do not suggest that regular coffee consumption is associated with large reductions in average sleep duration or with a different pattern of weekday versus weekend sleep in this NHANES adult sample. If anything, coffee drinkers may sleep marginally less on average, but the between-group differences are modest relative to the wide variability in sleep across individuals. As with other outcomes, these cross-sectional comparisons rely on self-reported sleep and are unadjusted for potential confounders (e.g., work schedules, shift work, stress, mental health), and thus should be interpreted cautiously as descriptive rather than causal.


### Coffee Intake and Diabetes Risk
Among participants with complete diabetes biomarker data (N = 2439), we compared fasting glucose, glycohemoglobin (HbA1c), and fasting insulin between adults with and without coffee intake habit. The bar plot shows mean biomarker levels with 95% confidence intervals by coffee habit, and the table summarizes group means, mean differences, confidence intervals, and p-values.

Across the three biomarkers, fasting glucose and HbA1c were very similar in coffee drinkers and non-drinkers, whereas fasting insulin remained substantially lower among coffee drinkers. The mean fasting glucose levels were 108.89 mg/dL in the no-coffee group and 109.48 mg/dL in the coffee group, with a mean difference of 0.58 mg/dL (95% CI: –2.93, 4.10; p = 0.745). Mean HbA1c levels were 5.71% and 5.76%, respectively, with a difference of 0.04 percentage points (95% CI: –0.06, 0.15; p = 0.427). For both markers, confidence intervals include zero and p-values are large, indicating no statistically significant difference in average glycemic control between the two groups. In contrast, fasting insulin averaged 17.35 μU/mL in non-drinkers and 12.12 μU/mL in coffee drinkers, with a mean difference of –5.23 μU/mL (95% CI: –7.89, –2.56; p ≈ 1.3×10⁻⁴), reflecting a statistically and clinically meaningful decrease in fasting insulin among those with a coffee habit.

From a diabetes-risk perspective, these findings suggest that habitual coffee intake is not associated with worse glycemic control as measured by fasting glucose and HbA1c in this adult NHANES sample. At the same time, lower fasting insulin at similar glucose and HbA1c levels may be consistent with differences in insulin sensitivity or insulin secretion—for example, better insulin sensitivity (requiring less insulin to maintain comparable glucose levels) or reduced β-cell secretory capacity. With cross-sectional data and only three biomarkers, we cannot distinguish between these mechanisms, and the implications for long-term diabetes risk remain uncertain.

Moreover, these comparisons are unadjusted and may be strongly influenced by confounding. Coffee drinkers in NHANES are likely to differ from non-drinkers in age, BMI, smoking, overall diet, physical activity, and socioeconomic factors, all of which affect glycemic control and diabetes risk. Therefore, the current results should not be interpreted as strong causal evidence that coffee itself increases or decreases diabetes risk. Instead, they highlight distinct diabetes biomarker profiles—particularly lower fasting insulin—among coffee-habit groups and motivate the next step of our analysis: regression models and examine dose–response relationships between caffeine intake and diabetes-related outcomes.
