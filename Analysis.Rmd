## Overview of analytic strategy
In this analysis, we first compared individuals (age range: 20-70) with and without coffee-drinking habits based on the results of two 24-hour dietary recall surveys and experimental biomarker data. Subsequently, we employed regression models to investigate the dose-response relationship between caffeine intake and selected biomarkers.

We organized the analysis in two steps: (1)  comparison between groups of individuals with and without coffee-intake habits, and (2) regression analyses with continuous caffeine intake as the exposure.


## Group Comparisons: Coffee Intake vs No Coffe Intake
### Coffee Intake and Diabetes Risk
Among participants with complete diabetes biomarker data (N = 2439), we compared fasting glucose, glycohemoglobin (HbA1c), and fasting insulin between adults with and without coffee intake habit. The bar plot shows mean biomarker levels with 95% confidence intervals by coffee habit, and the table summarizes group means, mean differences, confidence intervals, and p-values.

Across the three biomarkers, fasting glucose and HbA1c were very similar in coffee drinkers and non-drinkers, whereas fasting insulin remained substantially lower among coffee drinkers. The mean fasting glucose levels were 108.89 mg/dL in the no-coffee group and 109.48 mg/dL in the coffee group, with a mean difference of 0.58 mg/dL (95% CI: –2.93, 4.10; p = 0.745). Mean HbA1c levels were 5.71% and 5.76%, respectively, with a difference of 0.04 percentage points (95% CI: –0.06, 0.15; p = 0.427). For both markers, confidence intervals include zero and p-values are large, indicating no statistically significant difference in average glycemic control between the two groups. In contrast, fasting insulin averaged 17.35 μU/mL in non-drinkers and 12.12 μU/mL in coffee drinkers, with a mean difference of –5.23 μU/mL (95% CI: –7.89, –2.56; p ≈ 1.3×10⁻⁴), reflecting a statistically and clinically meaningful decrease in fasting insulin among those with a coffee habit.

From a diabetes-risk perspective, these findings suggest that habitual coffee intake is not associated with worse glycemic control as measured by fasting glucose and HbA1c in this adult NHANES sample. At the same time, lower fasting insulin at similar glucose and HbA1c levels may be consistent with differences in insulin sensitivity or insulin secretion—for example, better insulin sensitivity (requiring less insulin to maintain comparable glucose levels) or reduced β-cell secretory capacity. With cross-sectional data and only three biomarkers, we cannot distinguish between these mechanisms, and the implications for long-term diabetes risk remain uncertain.

Moreover, these comparisons are unadjusted and may be strongly influenced by confounding. Coffee drinkers in NHANES are likely to differ from non-drinkers in age, BMI, smoking, overall diet, physical activity, and socioeconomic factors, all of which affect glycemic control and diabetes risk. Therefore, the current results should not be interpreted as strong causal evidence that coffee itself increases or decreases diabetes risk. Instead, they highlight distinct diabetes biomarker profiles—particularly lower fasting insulin—among coffee-habit groups and motivate the next step of our analysis: regression models and examine dose–response relationships between caffeine intake and diabetes-related outcomes.
