## Overview of analytic strategy
In this analysis, we first compared individuals with and without coffee-drinking habits based on the results of two 24-hour dietary recall surveys and experimental biomarker data. Subsequently, we employed regression models to investigate the dose-response relationship between caffeine intake and selected biomarkers.

We organized the analysis in two steps: (1)  comparison between groups of individuals with and without coffee-intake habits, and (2) regression analyses with continuous caffeine intake as the exposure.
