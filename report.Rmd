## Motivation
Coffee, as one of the most popular beverages in the world, is highly favored by people. Since the caffeine in coffee has a regulatory effect on the central nervous system (Herqutanto et al., 2024), coffee is widely consumed for alertness. The debate over whether coffee is beneficial or harmful to human health is long standing. Some researchers suggest that moderate coffee consumption may help reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, and may be associated with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects (Barrea et al., 2023). However, other studies indicate that coffee intake could potentially increase the risk of certain cancers and fractures (Asoudeh et al., 2023; Carter et al., 2022). We wanted to explore the relationship between coffee intake and health through the analysis of large amounts of data and identify a reasonable intake level.

NHANES is uniquely well-suited for this study. NHANES contains nationally representative sampling with detailed, standardized measurements that are directly relevant to caffeine. It also contains clinically measured outcomes like blood pressure, pulse and BMI, meanwhile providing rich covariates such as age, sex, physical activity, and socioeconomic markers. By utilizing the abundant raw data, we can learn about the effect of coffee on human health and dose-response patterns through data analysis and draw transparent and reproducible public health inferences.
