<div id="overview-of-analytic-strategy" class="section level2">
<h2>Overview of analytic strategy</h2>
<p>In this analysis, we first compared individuals (age range: 20-70)
with and without coffee intake habits based on the results of two
24-hour dietary recall surveys and experimental biomarker data.
Subsequently, we employed regression models to investigate the
dose-response relationship between caffeine intake and selected
biomarkers.</p>
<p>We organized the analysis in two steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Comparison between groups of individuals with and without
coffee-intake habits.</li>
<li>Regression analyses with continuous caffeine intake as the
exposure.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="group-comparisons-coffee-intake-vs-no-coffe-intake"
class="section level2">
<h2>Group Comparisons: Coffee Intake vs No Coffe Intake</h2>
<div id="coffee-intake-and-blood-pressure-pulse" class="section level3">
<h3>Coffee Intake and Blood Pressure &amp; Pulse</h3>
<p>To assess whether habitual coffee consumption is related to blood
pressure and pulse, we compared systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic
blood pressure (DBP), and resting pulse between adults with and without
coffee-drinking habits. The violin plots with embedded boxplots display
the distributions of SBP and DBP by coffee habit, and a line plot shows
group means with 95% confidence intervals. Pulse-rate distributions were
visualized using ridgeline density plots.</p>
<p>The violin plots indicate that SBP and DBP distributions are very
similar between coffee drinkers and non-drinkers. There is a slight
upward shift in the coffee-habit group for SBP, reflected in the mean
plot as a small increase of only a few mmHg, whereas DBP means are
nearly identical in the two groups. In both cases, the 95% confidence
intervals overlap substantially, suggesting that any differences in
average blood pressure associated with habitual coffee intake are modest
and may not be statistically or clinically important.</p>
<p>For pulse rate, the ridgeline densities show broadly overlapping
distributions, with the coffee-habit group trending slightly higher in
pulse but again with only minor separation between curves. This pattern
suggests that regular coffee drinkers may have a somewhat higher resting
heart rate, but the magnitude of the difference appears small at the
population level.</p>
<p>From a cardiovascular-risk perspective, mean SBP and DBP in both
groups fall within the normotensive to mildly elevated range, and the
between-group differences are much smaller than thresholds used to
define hypertension (e.g., SBP ≥ 130 mmHg). Overall, our unadjusted
comparisons do not provide strong evidence that habitual coffee
consumption is associated with substantial chronic elevations in blood
pressure or resting pulse. As with the diabetes biomarkers, these
results are cross-sectional and may be confounded by age, BMI, smoking,
medication use, physical activity, and other lifestyle factors.
Therefore, they should be interpreted as descriptive and
hypothesis-generating. In subsequent regression analyses, we will
examine dose–response relationships between caffeine intake and blood
pressure and pulse while adjusting for key confounders.</p>
</div>
<div id="coffee-intake-and-sleep-status" class="section level3">
<h3>Coffee Intake and Sleep Status</h3>
<p>To explore whether habitual coffee consumption is related to sleep,
we compared self-reported sleep duration between adults with and without
coffee-intake habits. Average nightly sleep time was summarized using
violin plots with embedded boxplots, and a paired line plot was used to
display within-person differences between weekday and weekend sleep by
coffee habit.</p>
<p>The violin plots show that the overall distributions of average sleep
duration are very similar in coffee drinkers and non-drinkers. Both
groups cluster around roughly 7–8 hours of sleep per night, with a
comparable spread and long tails toward shorter and longer sleep. The
coffee-habit group appears to sleep slightly fewer hours on average, but
the central ranges of the two distributions overlap extensively,
suggesting that any difference in mean sleep time between coffee
drinkers and non-drinkers is relatively small.</p>
<p>The paired weekday–weekend plot highlights within-person patterns. In
coffee intake groups, individuals tend to sleep more on weekends than on
weekdays, consistent with “catch-up” sleep. The black summary lines
indicate that the magnitude of the weekday–weekend increase is nearly
the same for coffee drinkers and non-drinkers, implying that habitual
coffee use does not materially alter the typical pattern of shorter
weekday sleep and longer weekend sleep.</p>
<p>Taken together, these descriptive results do not suggest that regular
coffee consumption is associated with large reductions in average sleep
duration or with a different pattern of weekday versus weekend sleep in
this NHANES adult sample. If anything, coffee drinkers may sleep
marginally less on average, but the between-group differences are modest
relative to the wide variability in sleep across individuals. As with
other outcomes, these cross-sectional comparisons rely on self-reported
sleep and are unadjusted for potential confounders (e.g., work
schedules, shift work, stress, mental health), and thus should be
interpreted cautiously as descriptive rather than causal.</p>
</div>
<div id="coffee-intake-and-diabetes-risk" class="section level3">
<h3>Coffee Intake and Diabetes Risk</h3>
<p>Among participants with complete diabetes biomarker data (N = 2439),
we compared fasting glucose, glycohemoglobin (HbA1c), and fasting
insulin between adults with and without coffee intake habit. The bar
plot shows mean biomarker levels with 95% confidence intervals by coffee
habit, and the table summarizes group means, mean differences,
confidence intervals, and p-values.</p>
<p>Across the three biomarkers, fasting glucose and HbA1c were very
similar in coffee drinkers and non-drinkers, whereas fasting insulin
remained substantially lower among coffee drinkers. The mean fasting
glucose levels were 108.89 mg/dL in the no-coffee group and 109.48 mg/dL
in the coffee group, with a mean difference of 0.58 mg/dL (95% CI:
–2.93, 4.10; p = 0.745). Mean HbA1c levels were 5.71% and 5.76%,
respectively, with a difference of 0.04 percentage points (95% CI:
–0.06, 0.15; p = 0.427). For both markers, confidence intervals include
zero and p-values are large, indicating no statistically significant
difference in average glycemic control between the two groups. In
contrast, fasting insulin averaged 17.35 μU/mL in non-drinkers and 12.12
μU/mL in coffee drinkers, with a mean difference of –5.23 μU/mL (95% CI:
–7.89, –2.56; p ≈ 1.3×10⁻⁴), reflecting a statistically and clinically
meaningful decrease in fasting insulin among those with a coffee
habit.</p>
<p>From a diabetes-risk perspective, these findings suggest that
habitual coffee intake is not associated with worse glycemic control as
measured by fasting glucose and HbA1c in this adult NHANES sample. At
the same time, lower fasting insulin at similar glucose and HbA1c levels
may be consistent with differences in insulin sensitivity or insulin
secretion—for example, better insulin sensitivity (requiring less
insulin to maintain comparable glucose levels) or reduced β-cell
secretory capacity. With cross-sectional data and only three biomarkers,
we cannot distinguish between these mechanisms, and the implications for
long-term diabetes risk remain uncertain.</p>
<p>Moreover, these comparisons are unadjusted and may be strongly
influenced by confounding. Coffee drinkers in NHANES are likely to
differ from non-drinkers in age, BMI, smoking, overall diet, physical
activity, and socioeconomic factors, all of which affect glycemic
control and diabetes risk. Therefore, the current results should not be
interpreted as strong causal evidence that coffee itself increases or
decreases diabetes risk. Instead, they highlight distinct diabetes
biomarker profiles—particularly lower fasting insulin—among coffee-habit
groups and motivate the next step of our analysis: regression models and
examine dose–response relationships between caffeine intake and
diabetes-related outcomes.</p>
</div>
<div id="coffee-intake-and-cardiovascular-disease-risk"
class="section level3">
<h3>Coffee Intake and Cardiovascular Disease Risk</h3>
<p>To evaluate whether habitual coffee consumption is associated with
cardiovascular risk profiles, we compared three lipid biomarkers:
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol (LD), and total cholesterol, between adults with and without
coffee intake habit. The violin plot with embedded boxplot display the
distributions of each biomarker by coffee habit, and a summary table
reports group means, mean differences, 95% confidence intervals, and
p-values from two-sample t-tests.</p>
<p>Coffee drinkers had higher average levels of all three lipid markers,
although the strength of evidence varied by biomarker.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>HDL (“good” cholesterol): Mean HDL was 53.45 mg/dL in
non-drinkers and 56.32 mg/dL in coffee drinkers, with a mean difference
of 2.87 mg/dL (95% CI: 1.39, 4.35; p ≈ 0.00015). This indicates a
statistically significant and modestly higher HDL-C level among coffee
drinkers.</p></li>
<li><p>LDL: Mean LDL-C was 112.17 mg/dL in the No coffee group and
115.52 mg/dL in the Coffee habit group, for a difference of 3.36 mg/dL
(95% CI: –0.22, 6.94; p ≈ 0.066). The confidence interval includes zero
and the p-value is slightly above 0.05, suggesting only weak evidence
for higher LDL-C in coffee drinkers.</p></li>
<li><p>Total cholesterol: Mean total cholesterol was 187.33 mg/dL among
non-drinkers and 193.80 mg/dL among coffee drinkers, with a mean
difference of 6.47 mg/dL (95% CI: 2.28, 10.65; p ≈ 0.0025), indicating a
statistically significant but modest increase in total cholesterol
associated with coffee habit.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>From a CVD-risk perspective, this pattern is somewhat mixed but not
clearly adverse. The higher HDL among coffee drinkers is generally
considered protective, as higher HDL is associated with lower
cardiovascular risk. At the same time, coffee drinkers also show
slightly higher total cholesterol and possibly higher LDL-C, though the
LDL difference is small and only borderline significant. The absolute
differences in LDL-C and total cholesterol (≈3–6 mg/dL) are relatively
modest compared with clinical thresholds used to define dyslipidemia, so
their practical impact on risk is likely limited in isolation.</p>
<p>As with other outcomes in this study, these comparisons are
cross-sectional and unadjusted. Coffee drinkers may differ from
non-drinkers in diet, BMI, smoking, alcohol use, physical activity, and
use of lipid-lowering medications, all of which strongly influence lipid
levels. Consequently, the observed associations should not be
interpreted as causal effects of coffee itself on CVD risk. Rather, they
highlight that adults with a coffee habit in NHANES tend to have a lipid
profile characterized by higher HDL and slightly higher total
cholesterol, a combination whose net impact on cardiovascular risk is
uncertain and warrants further evaluation in adjusted regression models
and longitudinal studies.</p>
